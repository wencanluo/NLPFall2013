We will propose a model to predict conflicts for multi-part dialogue.

\section{Introduction}
Conflict is defined as disagreement between two or more people \cite{Paletz:2011}. In this paper, only short-term conflicts are considered. In other words, conflicts happen only in minutes but not a couple of days and not even longer.

The conflicts can be categorized by task, process, and relationship type \cite{Jehn:1995,Jehn:1997}. Linguistic researchers have argued that task conflict, under certain circumstances, can be beneficial, particularly for innovation \cite{Jehn:1997,West:2002}, whereas relationship and process conflict should hurt performance \cite{Jehn:1997}.

Thus, modeling conflicts in dialogues can be benefit to team development,

\section{The Corpus}

We are going to use the Eng data \cite{Jang:2012,Friedberg:2012}, collected in University of Pittsburgh.
It is a collection of natural dialogues among teams of college undergraduates working on their semester-long product design projects.
The conversations involve 2-6 individuals. Most of the students were engineering majors (e.g., electrical, mechanical, and industrial), but some teams also had marketing students as members.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Classification Model}
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sequence Labeling Model}

\subsection{Event-Graph Model}

\section{Future Work}
Predict conflict on speech.

\section{Timeline}

\noindent \emph{Sep 09 - Sep 22}
\begin{itemize}
  \item survey the related work regarding role recognition
  \item understanding the data, know how to extract and use the data
\end{itemize}

\noindent \emph{Sep 23 -  Oct 20}
\begin{itemize}
  \item implement the method in \cite{Garg:2008} using the manual transcription, the lexical model will be used as the local model
  \item do Automatical Speech Recognition (ASR)
  \item run the local model on ASR results
\end{itemize}

\noindent \emph{Oct 21 - Nov 9}
\begin{itemize}
  \item implement ILP global model, using the manual speaker segmentation
\end{itemize}

\noindent \emph{Nov 10 - Dec 12}
\begin{itemize}
  \item propose a model without the manual speaker segmentation
  \item try other global model such as Bayes network, improved social network
\end{itemize}
