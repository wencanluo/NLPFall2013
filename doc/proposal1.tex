\section{Introduction}

``People do not interact with one another as anonymous beings. They come together in the context of specific environments and with specific purposes" \cite{Tischler:1990}. As an example, people involved in multi-part dialogue usually play certain roles. For example, Radio Broadcasts

Speaker role is an important cue to the structure dialogue. It can be benefit to role-based summerization \cite{Vinciarelli:2006}, semantical coherent segmentation, information retrieval \cite{Weng:2007,Knapp:1972}, etc.

Role recognition is the task of automatically recognizing roles of participants in an interaction
recording. The goal is to assign to every participant in the recording of an interaction
(usually and audio recording or video recording) a role \cite{Salamin:2013}.

In this paper, we will propose a new method for role recognition, which combines both the global and local constraints. There are two intuitions behind: firstly, during a converstion, the role of a participant doesn't change; secondly, the defined roles should be taken evenly among the participants. Take a two-person interview for example. Firstly, a interviewer is always interviewing during the conversation; Secondly, if one is the interviewer and the other must be the interviewee.

\section{Related Work}

Barzilay et al. \shortcite{Barzilay:2000} exploited the lexical information (from ASR transcriptions) to identify 3 type of roles: Anchor, Journalist, Guest speakers in news broadcast.

Garg et al. \shortcite{Garg:2008} identified four predefined roles for multi-part meetings. It combined lexical features and social network (SNA) based on linear model. 
They also extracted features from the social network \cite{Salamin:2009}. 
Later, they proposed a graph model based on purely nonverbal vocal behavioral cues, including who talks when and how much (turn-taking behavior), and statistical properties of pitch, formants, energy and speaking rate (prosodic behavior)\cite{Salamin:2010}.

Dynamic Bayesian Networks \cite{Yaman:2010} is also used in role recognition.

\section{The Corpus}
The corpus I will use is the AMI
corpus \cite{McCowan:2005}, as same as one used in \cite{Garg:2008,Salamin:2009,Salamin:2010}.

The AMI corpus a collection of 138 meeting recordings for a total
of 45 hours and 38 minutes of material in a simulated environment. In each meeting, four partici-
pants play the following roles: the Project Man-
ager (PM), the Marketing Expert (ME), the User Interface
Expert (UI), and the Industrial Designer (ID). Each par-
ticipant plays a different role, and all roles are represented
in each meeting. The same person can play different roles
in different meetings, and the ratio of meeting time that
each role accounts for, on average, is reported in Table \ref{table:corpus}.

Currently, the state-of-art accuracy is 67.9\% on the AMI meeting corpus \cite{Garg:2008,Salamin:2013} by combining lexical information and social network analysis.
