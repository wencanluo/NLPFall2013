\section{Introduction}
Let a computer understand what people say is a long term goal. However, speech recognition (SR) is not perfect in current stage. 
In fact, compared to manual trascriptions, SR errors have a significant decrease in many NLP Tasks, such as Quesition Answering \cite{Turmo:2007}, Speaker Role Recognition \cite{Garg:2008}, Natural Language Understanding (NLU) \cite{Raymond:2007}, etc.

\section{Related Work}
\subsection{NLU}

NLU is a well-study field and many techniques have been proposed to improve the performance. For example, Eun at al.\shortcite{Eun:2005} showed that combining several different classifiers promoted the performance of natural language understanding. 
 
Besides, Both generative and discriminative models work pretty well for spoken language understanding \cite{Raymond:2007}.
 
However, majority of people work on human-transcribed text but rather than directly on speech recognition results. However, without ignoring the speech recognition errors, the performance is expected to decrease a lot.

\section{Methodology}

\section{Timeline}

\noindent \emph{Sep 09 - Sep 22}
\begin{itemize}
  \item survey the related work regarding role recognition
  \item understanding the data, know how to extract and use the data
\end{itemize}

\noindent \emph{Sep 23 -  Oct 20}
\begin{itemize}
  \item implement the method in \cite{Garg:2008} using the manual transcription, the lexical model will be used as the local model
  \item do Speech Recognition (SR)
  \item run the local model on SR results
\end{itemize}

\noindent \emph{Oct 21 - Nov 9}
\begin{itemize}
  \item implement ILP global model, using the manual speaker segmentation
\end{itemize}

\noindent \emph{Nov 10 - Dec 12}
\begin{itemize}
  \item propose a model without the manual speaker segmentation
  \item try other global model such as Bayes network, improved social network
\end{itemize}
