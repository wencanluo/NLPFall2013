The document itself\n  conforms to its own specifications, and is therefore an example of\n  what your manuscript should look like. These instructions should be used for both\n  papers submitted for review and for final versions of accepted\n  papers.  Authors are asked to conform\n  to all the directions reported in this document. \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Credits}\n\nThis document has been adapted from the instructions for earlier ACL proceedings, including those for ACL-2012 by Maggie Li and Michael White, those from ACL-2010 by Jing-Shing Chang and Philipp Koehn, those for ACL-2008 by Johanna D. Moore, Simone Teufel, James Allan, and Sadaoki Furui, those for ACL-2005 by Hwee Tou Ng and Kemal Oflazer, those for ACL-2002 by Eugene Charniak and Dekang Lin, and earlier ACL and EACL formats. Those versions were written by several people, including John Chen, Henry S. Thompson and Donald Walker. Additional elements were taken from the formatting instructions of the {\\em International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence}.\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nThe following instructions are directed to authors of papers submitted\nto ACL-2013 or accepted\nfor publication in its proceedings. All authors are required\nto adhere to these specifications. Authors are required to provide a\nPortable Document Format (PDF) \n% das: removed reference to PostScript\n% and PostScript \nversion of their papers. \\textbf{The proceedings will be printed on A4\n  paper}. Authors from countries in which access to word-processing\nsystems is limited should contact the publication chairs Roberto Navigli\n(\\texttt{navigli@di.uniroma1.it}) and Jing-Shin Chang (\\texttt{jshin@csie.ncnu.edu.tw}) as soon as possible.\n\n\\section{General Instructions}\n\nManuscripts must be in two-column format.  Exceptions to the\ntwo-column format include the title, authors' names and complete\naddresses, which must be centered at the top of the first page, and\nany full-width figures or tables (see the guidelines in\nSubsection~\\ref{ssec:first}). {\\bf Type single-spaced.}  Start all\npages directly under the top margin. See the guidelines later\nregarding formatting the first page.  The manuscript should be\nprinted single-sided and its length\nshould not exceed the maximum page limit described in Section~\\ref{sec:length}.\nDo not number the pages.\n\n\\subsection{Electronically-available resources}\n\nACL 2013 provides this description in \\LaTeX2e (acl2013.tex) and PDF\nformat (acl2013.pdf), along with the \\LaTeX2e style file used to\nformat it (acl2013.sty) and an ACL bibliography style\n(acl.bst). These files are all available at\n\\url{http://www.acl2013.org}. A Microsoft Word\ntemplate file (acl2013.dot) is also available at the same URL. We\nstrongly recommend the use of these style files, which have been\nappropriately tailored for the ACL 2013 proceedings. If you have an\noption, we recommend that you use the \\LaTeX2e version. \\textbf{If you will be\nusing the Microsoft Word template, we suggest that you anonymize your\nsource file so that the pdf produced does not retain your identity.}\nThis can be done by removing any personal information from your source\ndocument properties.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Format of Electronic Manuscript}\n\\label{sect:pdf}\n\nFor the production of the electronic manuscript you must use Adobe's\nPortable Document Format (PDF). This format can be generated from\npostscript files. On Linux/Unix systems, you can use {\\tt ps2pdf} for\nthis purpose. In Microsoft Windows, you can use Adobe's Distiller,\nor if you have \\textit{cygwin}\ninstalled, you can use \\textit{dvipdf} or \\textit{ps2pdf}. Note that\nsome word processing programs generate PDF which may not include all\nthe necessary fonts (esp. tree diagrams, symbols). When you print or\ncreate the PDF file, there is usually an option in your printer setup\nto include none, all or just non-standard fonts.  Please make sure\nthat you select the option of including ALL the fonts. {\\em Before\nsending it, test your PDF by printing it from a computer different\nfrom the one where it was created.} Moreover, some word processors may\ngenerate very large postscript/PDF files, where each page is rendered\nas an image. Such images may reproduce poorly. In this case, try\nalternative ways to obtain the postscript and/or PDF. One way on some\nsystems is to install a driver for a postscript printer, send your\ndocument to the printer specifying ``Output to a file'', then convert\nthe file to PDF.\n\nIt is of utmost importance to specify the \\textbf{A4 format} (21 cm\nx 29.7 cm) when formatting the paper. When working with\n{\\tt dvips}, for instance, one should specify {\\tt -t a4}.\n\nPrint-outs of the PDF file on A4 paper should be identical to the\nhardcopy version. If you cannot meet the above requirements about the\nproduction of your electronic submission, please contact the\npublication chairs above as soon as possible.\n\n\n\\subsection{Layout}\n\\label{ssec:layout}\n\nFormat manuscripts two columns to a page, in the manner these\ninstructions are formatted. The exact dimensions for a page on A4\npaper are:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Left and right margins: 2.5 cm\n\\item Top margin: 2.5 cm\n\\item Bottom margin: 2.5 cm\n\\item Column width: 7.7 cm\n\\item Column height: 24.7 cm\n\\item Gap between columns: 0.6 cm\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\noindent Papers should not be submitted on any other paper size.\n If you cannot meet the above requirements about the production of your electronic submission, please contact the publication chairs above as soon as possible.\n\n\n% Removed by KO  we are not accepting printed papers any more!!!\n%  Exceptionally,\n% authors for whom it is \\emph{impossible} to print on A4 paper may use\n% \\emph{US Letter} paper. In this case, they should keep the \\emph{top}\n% and \\emph{left} margins as given above, use the same column width,\n% height and gap, and modify the bottom and right margins as\n% necessary. Note that the text will no longer be centered.\n\n\\subsection{Fonts}\n\nFor reasons of uniformity, Adobe's {\\bf Times Roman} font should be\nused. In \\LaTeX2e{} this is accomplished by putting\n\n\\begin{quote}\n\\begin{verbatim}\n\\usepackage{times}\n\\usepackage{latexsym}\n\\end{verbatim}\n\\end{quote}\nin the preamble. If Times Roman is unavailable, use {\\bf Computer\n  Modern Roman} (\\LaTeX2e{}'s default).  Note that the latter is about\n  10\\% less dense than Adobe's Times Roman font.\n\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|rl|}\n\\hline \\bf Type of Text & \\bf Font Size & \\bf Style \\\\ \\hline\npaper title & 15 pt & bold \\\\\nauthor names & 12 pt & bold \\\\\nauthor affiliation & 12 pt & \\\\\nthe word ``Abstract'' & 12 pt & bold \\\\\nsection titles & 12 pt & bold \\\\\ndocument text & 11 pt  &\\\\\ncaptions & 11 pt & \\\\\nabstract text & 10 pt & \\\\\nbibliography & 10 pt & \\\\\nfootnotes & 9 pt & \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\label{font-table} Font guide. }\n\\end{table}\n\n\\subsection{The First Page}\n\\label{ssec:first}\n\nCenter the title, author's name(s) and affiliation(s) across both\ncolumns. Do not use footnotes for affiliations. Do not include the\npaper ID number assigned during the submission process. Use the\ntwo-column format only when you begin the abstract.\n\n{\\bf Title}: Place the title centered at the top of the first page, in\na 15-point bold font. (For a complete guide to font sizes and styles, see Table~\\ref{font-table}) Long titles should be typed on two lines without\na blank line intervening. Approximately, put the title at 2.5 cm from\nthe top of the page, followed by a blank line, then the author's\nnames(s), and the affiliation on the following line. Do not use only\ninitials for given names (middle initials are allowed). Do not format surnames\nin all capitals (e.g., use ``Schlangen'' not ``SCHLANGEN'').\nDo not format title and section headings in all capitals as well\nexcept for proper names (such as ``BLEU'') that are conventionally\nin all capitals.\nThe affiliation should contain the author's complete address, and if\npossible, an electronic mail address. Leave about 2 cm between the\naffiliation and the body of the first page.\nThe title, author names and addresses should be completely\nidentical to those entered to the electronical paper submission\nwebsite in order to maintain the consistency of author information\namong all publications of the conference.\n\n{\\bf Abstract}: Type the abstract at the beginning of the first\ncolumn. The width of the abstract text should be smaller than the\nwidth of the columns for the text in the body of the paper by about\n0.6 cm on each side. Center the word {\\bf Abstract} in a 12 point bold\nfont above the body of the abstract. The abstract should be a concise\nsummary of the general thesis and conclusions of the paper. It should\nbe no longer than 200 words. The abstract text should be in 10 point font.\n\n{\\bf Text}: Begin typing the main body of the text immediately after\nthe abstract, observing the two-column format as shown in \nthe present document. Do not include page numbers.\n\n{\\bf Indent} when starting a new paragraph. Use 11 points for text and \nsubsection headings, 12 points for section headings and 15 points for\nthe title. \n\n\\subsection{Sections}\n\n{\\bf Headings}: Type and label section and subsection headings in the\nstyle shown on the present document.  Use numbered sections (Arabic\nnumerals) in order to facilitate cross references. Number subsections\nwith the section number and the subsection number separated by a dot,\nin Arabic numerals. Do not number subsubsections.\n\n{\\bf Citations}: Citations within the text appear\nin parentheses as~\\cite{Gusfield:97} or, if the author's name appears in\nthe text itself, as Gusfield~\\shortcite{Gusfield:97}. \nAppend lowercase letters to the year in cases of ambiguity.  \nTreat double authors as in~\\cite{Aho:72}, but write as in~\\cite{Chandra:81} when more than two authors are involved. Collapse multiple citations as in~\\cite{Gusfield:97,Aho:72}. Also refrain from using full citations as sentence constituents. We suggest that instead of\n\\begin{quote}\n  ``\\cite{Gusfield:97} showed that ...''\n\\end{quote}\nyou use\n\\begin{quote}\n``Gusfield \\shortcite{Gusfield:97}   showed that ...''\n\\end{quote}\n\nIf you are using the provided \\LaTeX{} and Bib\\TeX{} style files, you\ncan use the command \\verb|\\newcite| to get ``author (year)'' citations.\n\nAs reviewing will be double-blind, the submitted version of the papers should not include the\nauthors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that\nreveal the author's identity, e.g.,\n\\begin{quote}\n``We previously showed \\cite{Gusfield:97} ...''  \n\\end{quote}\nshould be avoided. Instead, use citations such as \n\\begin{quote}\n``Gusfield \\shortcite{Gusfield:97}\npreviously showed ... ''\n\\end{quote}\n\n\\textbf{Please do not  use anonymous citations} and  do not include acknowledgements when submitting your papers. Papers that do not conform\nto these requirements may be rejected without review. \n\n\\textbf{References}: Gather the full set of references together under\nthe heading {\\bf References}; place the section before any Appendices,\nunless they contain references. Arrange the references alphabetically\nby first author, rather than by order of occurrence in the text.\nProvide as complete a citation as possible, using a consistent format,\nsuch as the one for {\\em Computational Linguistics\\/} or the one in the \n{\\em Publication Manual of the American \nPsychological Association\\/}~\\cite{APA:83}.  Use of full names for\nauthors rather than initials is preferred.  A list of abbreviations\nfor common computer science journals can be found in the ACM \n{\\em Computing Reviews\\/}~\\cite{ACM:83}.\n\nThe \\LaTeX{} and Bib\\TeX{} style files provided roughly fit the\nAmerican Psychological Association format, allowing regular citations, \nshort citations and multiple citations as described above.\n\n{\\bf Appendices}: Appendices, if any, directly follow the text and the\nreferences (but see above).  Letter them in sequence and provide an\ninformative title: {\\bf Appendix A. Title of Appendix}.\n\n\\textbf{Acknowledgement} section should go as a last section immediately\nbefore the references.  Do not number the acknowledgement section.\n\n\\subsection{Footnotes}\n\n{\\bf Footnotes}: Put footnotes at the bottom of the page and use 9\npoints text. They may be numbered or referred to by asterisks or other\nsymbols.\\footnote{This is how a footnote should appear.} Footnotes\nshould be separated from the text by a line.\\footnote{Note the line\nseparating the footnotes from the text.}\n\n\\subsection{Graphics}\n\n{\\bf Illustrations}: Place figures, tables, and photographs in the\npaper near where they are first discussed, rather than at the end, if\npossible.  Wide illustrations may run across both columns.  Color\nillustrations are discouraged, unless you have verified that  \nthey will be understandable when printed in black ink.\n\n{\\bf Captions}: Provide a caption for every illustration; number each one\nsequentially in the form:  ``Figure 1. Caption of the Figure.'' ``Table 1.\nCaption of the Table.''  Type the captions of the figures and \ntables below the body, using 11 point text.  \n\n\\section{Translation of non-English Terms}\n\nIt is also advised to supplement non-English characters and terms\nwith appropriate transliterations and/or translations\nsince not all readers understand all such characters and terms.\nInline transliteration or translation can be represented in\nthe order of: original-form transliteration ``translation''.\n\n\\section{Length of Submission}\n\\label{sec:length}\n\nLong papers may consist of up to 8 pages of content, plus two extra pages for references\nand short papers may consist of up to 4 pages of content, plus two extra pages for references, in the proceedings.\nPapers that do not conform to the specified length and formatting requirements are\nsubject to be rejected without review.\n\n\\section{Other Issues}\n\nThose papers that had software and/or dataset submitted for the review process should also submit it \nwith the camera-ready paper. Besides, the software and/or dataset should not be anonymous. \n\nPlease note that the publications of ACL 2013 will be publicly available at ACL Anthology \n(http://aclweb.org/anthology-new/) on July 28th, 2013, one week before the start of the conference. \nSince some of the authors may have plans to file patents related to their papers in the conference, \nwe are sending this reminder that July 28th, 2013 may be considered to be the official publication date, \ninstead of the opening day of the conference.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\n\nDo not number the acknowledgment section.
